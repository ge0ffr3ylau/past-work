# My Portfolio

Hi, My name is Geoffrey and I am looking for a job in a data analytic role!

This repo mainly serves as a portfolio type of hub, where I uploaded a few programming works that I worked on before.

Knowing that my experience in programming is really scarce, I now notice that I need to take more initiative, and utilize the available resources on the web to prepare for any opportunities that arises for me in the future.

***With that in mind, the things I am working on right now are:***

## Leetcode

**Working on my SQL and Python programming skills.**

My first tenure after my gruadation was the role of a Fintech solutions consultant. The nature of the job doesn't require me to use any programming languages such as Python and SQL, but rather Microsoft Excel or proprietary cloud platform software.

Hence when I am looking for a job that utilizes more on SQL and Python, I can only rely on the programming knowledge that I've got during my Bachelors. I didn't actively seek for programming opportunities beyond my learning curriculum at that time, nor did I know where to start gaining experience from.

Realizing that, I decided to continue developing my programming skills using Leetcode, where I am working on 3-4 coding exercises everyday. 

For now, I am focusing on SQL and Python, as I started learning them during my bachelors, and most of the jobs that I'm now looking for, mandates these two languages as well.

By doing so, I hope I can slowly but surely accumulate more programming experience, and hopefully create a coding habit that I can keep for the foreseeable future.

## The Odin Project

**Learning more about website development.**

I have touched upon HTML, CSS, PHP in my secondary school.

I never had the chance on website development afterwards, nor did I know where to start from, or what website to create. I always appreciate and wonder how people can develop creative, aesthetically pleasing websites, judging from the very limited and fundamental knowledge that I've got.

Once I heard about [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) from a friend and from videos on Youtube, I decided it would be a great opportunity for me to learn more about website development, to understand more about how websites are being built, and especially to know more about the thought process and effort behind each website.

The final objective of this learning is to create my very own portfolio website in the near future, and to use it to serve as a hub to demonstrate what I can do. This won't be something that can be done in a very short time, but it is something, _kind of like an end-goal_, that I can strive for.

You can dig around my github account profile to see some other repos I've set up for the exercise I have been going through with The Odin Project.
