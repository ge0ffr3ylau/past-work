# Python Projects

Here are some of the work that I have done in the past. Not all work will be posted here.

***Context for each posted work are as follow:***

## Simplex & Markowitz ## 
**Coding on optimiation algorithms.**

These two coding assignments are from my academic exchange to Sweden KTH during 2019.

The objective is to code from scratch, either with matlab or python, to renact the mathematical optimization theories that were taught in the class. I used python through the Spyder software from the [Anaconda Package Environment](https://www.anaconda.com/).

I thoroughly enjoyed the coding process as it was the first time that I completely coded from scratch. It took me a lot of effort to research on the topic, formulate the algorithm, and debug my coding to reach the final outcome.

The work may not seem to be very sophisticated, but it is something that I myself treasure and can be proud of.
